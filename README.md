# webgpu-test

This example invoke N times a compute shader to emit N triangles stored into a SSBO (Shader Storage Buffer Object). SSBO was binded to a VBO (Vertex Buffer Object). Therefore, the vertex shader takes as input the triangles previously generated by the compute shader. 

Note that the value of N is hard-coded and all the code is contained in a single file to provide an overview of WebGPU initialization and the creation of pipelines, buffers, etc.
This is just an example.
